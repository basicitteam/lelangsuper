				      		The first Honda Jazz appeared on UK price lists in 1982. Known as the Honda City outside Europe, this was a small hatchback, which, like its more recent namesakes, used quasi-MPV proportions to maximise interior space. After the demise of the first Jazz in 1986, Honda did not return to the supermini segment until 2000, when it briefly imported the already ageing and rather dull Logo. The Jazz name returned in 2002, to much critical acclaim.

We’re not sure whether the old adage ‘If it ain’t broke don’t fix it’ translates well into Japanese, but Honda’s engineers must have uttered the local equivalent when designing this model. So while it is almost entirely new, you’ll not be surprised to learn the latest Jazz is not as revolutionary as the first. The focus is still on practicality and versatility, with tweaks to the exterior dimensions and promised improvements to the dynamic repertoire. The greatest single change is Honda’s attempt to sharpen the styling to appeal more to younger, more image-conscious buyers
