				      		When the original Galaxy Note came out it took the world by storm, with its unique shape and size.  Not many people thought a phone that big would be a big seller, but the Galaxy Note proved them wrong.  When Samsung put out its even bigger brother they again revolutionized the Phablet world.  Seems as if any phone over 5 inches will get classified differently than the standard smartphone.  You can also check out the video review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 right here.

Galaxy Note 2 Design
The Note 2 takes a lot of its design cues from the Samsung Galaxy S3, which is fine by many. While slightly heavier than the original Note, it comes in with a bigger screen and thinner than the original Note.

No matter how you look at it, putting this phone to your ear will definitely get some looks as it is a huge phone.  However the look of the phone is quite pleasing.  Around the outside of the phone you have your standard 3.5mm headphone jack, the volume rocker and the power button on the right side of the device.  The microUSB connection on the bottom of the device and then the rounded home button and the two capacitive touch buttons make up the entire outside design of the Note 2.

Galaxy Note 2 Features

Starting with the 5.5” screen the upgrades to the Note 2 are plenty, however it falls short in one key area and that is screen resolution.  It only comes in at 720p now I am not saying that the screen isn’t clear or it comes in grainy because that isn’t the case.  The screen still has a very nice look to it but it could always be better.
