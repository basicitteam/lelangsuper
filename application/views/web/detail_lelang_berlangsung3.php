				      		The 2013 Honda Civic ranks 22 out of 43 Affordable Small Cars. This ranking is based on our analysis of 21 published reviews and test drives of the Honda Civic, and our analysis of reliability and safety data.

According to critics, the 2013 Honda Civic’s improved interior materials and additional standard features make it class-competitive, but its performance and cabin space are merely adequate.

The Honda Civic comes in base, Si, HF and Hybrid models. The Honda Civic Hybrid is reviewed separately. Each has a different powertrain setup, but they all have a four-cylinder gasoline engine. The base Civic’s engine makes 140 horsepower, and while test drivers think it provides the Civic with good highway acceleration, they think some competitors feel more powerful. The EPA hasn’t released fuel economy ratings for the base Civic, but Honda says it averages 28/39 mpg city/highway. The Si’s four-cylinder engine produces 201 horsepower, and critics report that the difference in acceleration is noticeable. The base Civic has five-speed manual and automatic transmissions. Reviewers don’t complain about either one, but some wish that they had six gears like many rivals. For the 2013 model year, Honda tightened the Civic’s suspension, and say that the steering is balanced and that the ride isn’t too soft or too stiff.
